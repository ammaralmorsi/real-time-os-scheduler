Generator:
    list of processes data <- readInputFile()
    Algorithm type <- Ask user for Algorithm
    fork clock
    fork schedular
    stop schedular
    do foever
        see if time to generate a process
        if so pass it in the queue
        continue schedular
        stop myself

Schedular:
    should initiate its parameters given by the generator
    do forever
        check if new process are in the message queue
        if so 
            create PCB for them and add them in the ready queue
            fork the new processes
            stop all of them
        do scheduling algorithm in the ready queue
        continue generator
        stop myself
