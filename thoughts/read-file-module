the read file module
- inputs:
  - the name of the file to get the input from
- output:
  - structure that has an array of process_given_information and the size of that array

algorithm:
- open the file specified
- if opend
  - open a new pre processed file
  - if opend
    - ignore from a line begin with '#'
    - count number of lines that has no '#' at the begining
    - store those line as they is in a preproccesd file
    - close that file
    - close that file
  - else
    - assert error
- else
  - assert error

- create a new block of memory of size process_given_information * number of lines that not begin with '#'
- open the preprocessed file again
- if opened
  - store using scanf 4 by 4 the input data in the new created array
- else
  - assert error

- return a structure {number of processes, pointer to the array of process_given_info}
